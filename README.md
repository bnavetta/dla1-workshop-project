## Model

This uses Sung Kim's [word-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow),
which is based on Sherjil Ozair's [char-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow), which is
in turn based on
Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). I've rearranged the files to make them an
importable Python package along with the rest of my code.
